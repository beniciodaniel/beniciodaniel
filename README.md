### ðŸš€ Currently 
I'm currently participating in a Bootcamp (Rocketseat). I am developing web and mobile applications using React JS, React Native, Node JS, Typescript, Express, Multer, among other technologies / libraries.

### ðŸ’» Work Experiences 
## ReactJS | NextJS | Typescript | GraphQL
I had the opportunity to work in a collaborative agile team using Scrum with a 2-week sprint (Jira / Bitbucket). I was able to contribute to the development of a web application using Typescript, Javascript, React JS (with hooks), Next JS, GraphQL, Apollo, Styled-Components and UI components of Ant Design. I worked helping to develop and or improve interfaces with new forms, validating values, creating new components, replacing components with others from other libraries, among other activities inherent to my role. To run the application server locally, I used Docker containers.

## Laravel 5.8 | PHP | MySQL
From September 2019 to May 2020 I worked as a frontend intern helping in the development of a web application whose objective was to manage and control entries and exits of Personal Protective Equipment products in large industries. I worked using some technologies like Laravel framework (5.8), PHP, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS in Linux environment (Ubuntu). I also collaborated with the application documentation and the backend development.
